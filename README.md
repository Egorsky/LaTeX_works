# LaTex_works

This repo is about replicating book "Pompy Wirowe" by Adam T. Troskolański. 

# Idea & implementation

Considering that MS Word is not tecessary the best way to replecate book pages, especially this happens when it comes to pages with multiple formulas. This is where LaTeX is very useful due to its high flexibility and controllability. The task itself was assigned to me as a part of my PhD studies in Wroclaw University of Science an Technology. Big thanks to dr inż. Przemysław Scherwentke.
